GitHub Badges are incredibly useful, they can boost the readability of a Repository by providing users with a fast way to capture the Repository metrics. Badges also make your Repository look attractive and cool all you need to do is import Markdown code from a source to your README.md file.

#### There are many GitHub badges available on the internet, here are the top five most informative badges to include in your README file. Markdown code is provided for every badge that I have listed below : 

# 1. Contributors Badge

<!--If you view this code ps: Ignore the unethical ways used for formatting-->

#### Contributors badge displays images of all the people who have contributed to your Repository. It's really a good habit to credit the contributors who have invested their time in providing an update to your repository. All you need to do is copy the code below in your README file
``` ![GitHub Contributors Image](https://contrib.rocks/image?repo=Your_GitHub_Username/Your_GitHub_Repository_Name) ```
